# Gradient Descent and Newton's method examples

Introducing some computational issues in numerical optimization using the gradient descent method.

## Question 1

Given our function, we are applying the Gradient Descent and Newton's method algorithms. We conclude that Newton's methods converges faster than Gradient Descent.

## Question 2

Using a differenet function, we calculate it's condition number and then run the Gradient Descent Momemntum algorithm. 

## Question 3

Making a specific assumption, we're comparing with the results of Question 2.

## Question 4

We apply the Gradient Descent method to aour given funtion and for different steps we check for convergence
